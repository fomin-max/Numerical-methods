# Numerical-methods
Program implementation of numerical methods on various topics. To solve a system of linear algebraic equations: the method of rotation, steepest descent, conjugate gradients. For a system of nonlinear equations: the Halley's, Newton-Raphson, and Chebyshev methods. To find the eigenvalues: the method of coordinate relaxation and the QR-algorithm. Interpolation of the function: Lagrange interpolation polynomial and Newton's formula on the initial nodes.
